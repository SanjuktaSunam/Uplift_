            About Music 
        </h1>
        <p>Music is something which has different definition for every people. No one can define music because I think it is something which neither has starting nor ending.
            There are so much variety of music in this world. In my view a perfect musician is someone who can find music even in the sound of rainfall , sound of birds chirping , foot sounds of soldiers doing parade etc.
            Besides from only entertainment , music can even work as a painkiller for a sad person. </p>
